1. It took me about 10 hours or so to complete this lab.

2. It is kinda concerning that v2 comes first in the struct, which kinda messed some things up for me. 

3. I used gdb a lot in this lab. I used gdb to make sure that each function was working correctly, for example, mov operations as well as leaq operations. I also
used gdb to see the return values of different functions for example EOF in fscanf and null pointers with malloc to make sure that everything was working properly.
I also used gdb to find that I was actually using some wrong registers that were causing some problems. For example, I was using the file name from argv instead of
the file pointer in readLines which caused lots of problems.
